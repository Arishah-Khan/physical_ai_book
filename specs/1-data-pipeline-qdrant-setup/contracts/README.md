# API Contracts

This directory contains API contracts for the RAG chatbot system.

For Phase 1 (Data Pipeline and Qdrant Setup), there are no direct API endpoints as this phase focuses on data ingestion and processing. API contracts will be generated in later phases when the FastAPI backend is implemented.

The data pipeline operates through a command-line interface (ingest.py) that processes documentation files and uploads them to Qdrant.

title: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
---

### Overview of Physical AI

Physical AI explores the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, enabling robots and other embodied agents to perceive, reason, and act in the real world. This field is crucial for developing autonomous systems that can perform complex tasks, adapt to dynamic environments, and interact safely with humans.

### Importance of Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence emphasizes that intelligence is not merely abstract computation but is deeply intertwined with a physical body and its interactions with the environment. Robots with embodied intelligence can learn through direct experience, develop practical skills, and navigate the complexities of the real world more effectively than purely disembodied AI systems.

### Course Focus & Theme

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles and applications of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It focuses on the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and ethical considerations necessary to design, build, and deploy intelligent robots capable of performing complex tasks in human-centric environments. The overarching theme is the convergence of AI, robotics, and human-like interaction.

### Quarter Overview

This course is structured across a typical academic quarter, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced applications. Early modules establish core knowledge in robotics and AI, while later modules delve into complex topics like human-robot interaction, advanced control, and ethical considerations. The quarter culminates in a project applying learned principles.

### High-level Module Summary

The course is divided into several modules, each building upon the previous one. Modules cover topics from robot kinematics and dynamics, perception systems, motion planning, and machine learning for robotics, to advanced humanoid control and ethical considerations in AI and robotics. Each module integrates theoretical knowledge with practical examples and exercises.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: 1) Explain the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. 2) Design and implement basic robotic control algorithms. 3) Analyze and apply machine learning techniques to robotic perception and decision-making. 4) Understand the ethical implications of deploying intelligent autonomous systems.

### Hardware and Software Requirements (brief)

Students will need access to a computer capable of running modern simulation software (e.g., Gazebo, Unity) and development environments (e.g., ROS 2, Python). Specific hardware for hands-on robotics projects may be recommended but are not strictly required for course completion, with simulation alternatives provided.

### Notes for Future Expansion

This introduction is a living document and will be expanded with more detailed information, additional diagrams, updated references, and a comprehensive glossary as the course content evolves. Future iterations will include specific software versions, hardware recommendations for hands-on labs, and links to external resources.

# Implementation Plan: Phase 2 - OpenAI Agents SDK Implementation

**Branch**: `1-openai-agents-sdk-implementation` | **Date**: 2025-12-14 | **Spec**: [specs/1-openai-agents-sdk-implementation/spec.md](specs/1-openai-agents-sdk-implementation/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using OpenAI Agents SDK, FastAPI, and Qdrant vector database. The system will feature specialized agents for greetings, documentation queries, and selected text processing, with REST API endpoints for user interaction.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Qdrant Client, Google Generative AI, Pydantic
**Storage**: Qdrant vector database (reusing from Phase 1), with metadata storage for source citations
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Linux server (containerizable)
**Project Type**: Web backend service with API endpoints
**Performance Goals**: <5 second response time for queries, 95% success rate on API requests
**Constraints**: <5 second p95 response time, must integrate with existing Phase 1 data pipeline and vector database
**Scale/Scope**: Single service supporting multiple concurrent users, leveraging existing Phase 1 infrastructure

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ **LIBRARY-FIRST Approach**: Components will be modular (services, agents, API layers) with reusable functions
- ✅ **AI-Native Experience**: Implements RAG chatbot as specified in constitution
- ✅ **Education Excellence & Accuracy**: Will ensure technical correctness in implementation
- ✅ **Technical & Security Constraints**: Uses approved stack (FastAPI, Qdrant, OpenAI Agents)
- ✅ **Open & Versioned Development**: Will follow versioning practices and document changes

**Structure Decision**: Following the web application pattern with a backend service that integrates with existing Phase 1 infrastructure. The structure separates concerns into services (for data access), agents (for AI logic), and API (for web interface) as specified in the workflow document.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive implementation plan with research, data models, quickstart guide, and API contracts for OpenAI Agents SDK implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests needed for planning phase
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/api-contract.md, and updated claude.agent.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase completed all required artifacts including technical context, data models, and API contracts

# Response

```
Completed comprehensive planning for Phase 2 (FastAPI Backend + RAG + ChatKit Agent Implementation) including:

- Implementation plan with technical context and architecture decisions
- Research document with technology decisions and rationale
- Data model with entities and state transitions
- Quickstart guide for setup and deployment
- API contracts (OpenAPI specification)
- Agent context updates for rag-api-builder with OpenAI Agents SDK patterns

The planning maintains compatibility with Phase 1 work while providing a clear roadmap for implementing the FastAPI backend with RAG and ChatKit Agent functionality.

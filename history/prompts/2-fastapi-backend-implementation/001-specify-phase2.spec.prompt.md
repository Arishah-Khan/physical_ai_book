```

# Response

```
Created comprehensive specification for Phase 2 (FastAPI Backend + RAG + ChatKit Agent Implementation) based on the engineering specification document. The specification includes:

- User scenarios for RAG-based queries and selected text context queries
- Functional requirements for the backend API endpoints
- Success criteria for measuring the system's performance
- Quality validation checklist

The specification follows the template structure and maintains compatibility with Phase 1 work.

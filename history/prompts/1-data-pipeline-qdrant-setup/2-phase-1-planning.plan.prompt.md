# Implementation Plan: Data Pipeline and Qdrant Setup

**Branch**: `1-data-pipeline-qdrant-setup` | **Date**: 2025-12-12 | **Spec**: [link](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-data-pipeline-qdrant-setup/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a data pipeline to ingest Docusaurus documentation into Qdrant vector database. This includes reading markdown files, converting to clean text, chunking with overlap, generating embeddings using Google Gemini, and storing in Qdrant with proper metadata. This forms the foundational RAG system for the AI textbook.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Qdrant Client, Google Generative AI, BeautifulSoup4, Pydantic
**Storage**: Qdrant Cloud vector database
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Web backend service
**Performance Goals**: Process typical documentation set under 10 minutes, 99% success rate for content processing
**Constraints**: <200MB memory usage during processing, handle up to 100MB documentation sets, maintain metadata integrity
**Scale/Scope**: Single documentation set with multiple markdown files, potentially thousands of chunks

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the constitution, this implementation adheres to the core principles:
- Education Excellence & Accuracy: Properly processes educational content for AI assistance
- AI-Native Experience: Enables RAG functionality for AI chatbot
- LIBRARY-FIRST Approach: Modular components for reading, converting, chunking, embedding
- TDD: Will include validation of successful ingestion and processing
- Personalization & Localization: Supports the broader system goals
- Open & Versioned Development: Following proper versioning and documentation
- Deployment & Accessibility: Enables the public textbook with AI features

**Structure Decision**: Web backend service structure chosen to support the RAG chatbot system as specified in the engineering document. The data ingestion components are organized in a dedicated module with clear separation of concerns.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Research completed in `research.md` with decisions on:
- Technology stack selection (Python, FastAPI, Qdrant, Google Gemini)
- Document processing pipeline architecture
- Error handling strategy
- Configuration management
- Memory management approach

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model
Entity definitions created in `data-model.md`:
- Documentation Chunk
- Embedding Vector
- Qdrant Collection
- Processing Configuration

### API Contracts
API contracts are not applicable for Phase 1 as this focuses on data ingestion pipeline.
Placeholder created in `contracts/README.md`.

### Quickstart Guide
Setup and execution instructions created in `quickstart.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 1 data pipeline
- 🧪 Tests: Research and data model provide testable architecture
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts/README.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase completed successfully with all required artifacts

goal:
  Create a complete Docusaurus-based textbook for the course:
  **"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"**
  following the official course outline provided in the hackathon instructions.
  The output should automatically generate:
    - docs/intro.md
    - One folder per module
    - Chapters inside every module
    - Full book structure, navigation, sidebar, titles
    - Professional textbook-style content
    - Clean Markdown formatting

requirements:
  - All files must be placed inside `/docs/`
  - Create sidebar structure automatically
  - Each module must be a separate directory in docs
  - Each module must contain multiple chapters based on the weekly breakdown
  - All content should be written for university-level students
  - Explanations must be technical, clear, and educational
  - Include diagrams (Mermaid), learning outcomes, examples, and summaries in each chapter
  - Generate:
      * docs/intro.md
      * docs/module-1-ros2/*
      * docs/module-2-gazebo-unity/*
      * docs/module-3-isaac/*
      * docs/module-4-vla/*
      * docs/capstone/*
      * docs/hardware/*
  - Create a clean and professional structure for a real published textbook
